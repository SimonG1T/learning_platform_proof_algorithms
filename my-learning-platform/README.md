# my-learning-platform - Angular & Electron App

This app is a learning platform for proof-algorithms in logic.
The central focus here is on the resolution and tableau method, which includes a theory section, examples, an automatic test and exercises for independent usage.

In addition, the platform offers a general theory section for the basics of proof-algorithms and logic.

The DPLL method was added as an extension.
