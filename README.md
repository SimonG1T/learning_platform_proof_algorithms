Learning Platform for Proof Algorithms

This App contains sections to learn about proof algorithms in logic.

Algorithms:
 * Resolution Procedure
 * Tableau Procedure
 * DPLL-Procedure

Sections for each procedure:
 * Theory: A general overview of the procedure
 * Example: Step-by-step solution with explanation
 * Test: An automatic generator for quick creation and solutions
 * Exercise: A section with feedback for self learning

Additional there is a general theory section for the reminder of proof algorithms and closing rules.
